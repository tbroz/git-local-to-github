I am 27 years old. I was a welder for 7 years and transitioned into a love for web development a couple years ago. I am pursuing my Associates of Applied 
Science for Multimedia and Web Development and will be graduating next year. I have been named to the 2022 - 2023 All-Missouri Academic Team, which is an 
incredible academic honor as only 57 students in Missouri were chosen. I am married to a lovely man named Drew Broz. We met in 2013 playing video games 
online, and our 10 year anniversary will be this November. We have 3 cats, they are the light of my life as I tend to hate people. Every night they sleep 
with me, and always keep me company around the house. Their names are Sonny, Luna, and Bugs. Sonny and Luna are both 9 and Bugs is 7.
